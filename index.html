            <div class="article p1">
                <p> My name is Xidi Wang, and People could call me Darren. My hometown is Yunnan, a province in China
                    that borders Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos. Although it is not a wealthy place, different cultures are
                    confluence here, and it has excellent natural resources and good weather. It is famous for tourism.
                    I was living with my parents when I lived in China. My father was always working outside, and my
                    mother was a housewife.

                    Software development is not my first choice. I wanted to enroll in the CAD technical at first, but
                    there was no sit for that program. I came to MITT because I want to find a job to get PR in Canada,
                    so I don't wish to just wait until January. Also, there are many generalities between the two
                    programs, that they both need people using computer language to write instructions to finish some
                    objectives. I thought I could learn CAD without instruction if I mastered software development.
                    Let's be honest I am a lazy guy, and in my opinion, the essential function of technology is it saves
                    people's time doing duplicate labor to have more time to relax or study.

                    I like video games and anime. I collect many figures from some anime and video games, and most of
                    the collection is the transformers. I think the transformers are ensembles of modern industry and
                    design. I like to play video games in my free time, but I am not a good player.
